Ma. Loryn Claire Pecho

Learning is a never ending process once must possess in order to grow. As I continue to seek for a new job I've also used my time to level up professionally by attending online workshops, exploring Wix, Gamma, and ClickUp.

I am an experienced Customer Success Specialist with over 10 years in telecommunications and SaaS industries. Originally trained as a licensed educator who explored several small businesses that enhanced my administrative operations skills that drive process improvement.
